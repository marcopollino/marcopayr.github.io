Using TIRF microscopy we are investigating how RNA-binding proteins assemble onto an mRNA to repress its translation looking at mRNP stability, cooperativity of RBPs, how RNA structure mediates the kinetics of assembly and lastly target motif recognition. If I\u0026rsquo;m not in the lab, you can find me bouldering, skiing, rock climbing or coding.\nLinkedIn\nGitHub\nTwitter\nDuss Lab\nHennig Lab\n","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/contact/","section":"Marco Payr","summary":"I am a PhD student in the labs of Janosch Hennig and Olivier Duss at EMBL Heidelberg.","title":"About Me"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/tags/education/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"education"},{"content":" \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e Predoctoral fellow EMBL Heidelberg 2020-present Supervisor: Olivier Duss, Janosch Hennig Real-time interaction studies of RNA binding proteins to study kinetics of mRNP assembly via single-molecule FRET (TIRF fluorescence microscopy) Peptide-tag and cysteine-maleimide conjugation based fluorophore labeling of proteins RNA in-vitro transcription and purification Conceptualization of a research project with successful funding by the Boehringer Ingelheim Founds (BIF) Scholarship Co-author of a peer-reviewed publication \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\" standalone=\"no\"?\u003e image/svg+xmlTUM_Web_Logo_blau TUM_Web_Logo_blau TUM Master student, Technical University of Munich 2018-2020 Supervisor: Timon Nast-Kolb \u0026amp; Dr. Andreas Bausch Reconstitution of actin networks on supported lipid bilayers and characterization of actin-binding proteins using fluorescence microscopy (Confocal \u0026 TIRF) Co-Author of a peer-reviewed publication Measurement of osmolarity ","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/education/","section":"Marco Payr","summary":"\u003c?","title":"Education"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/tags/experience/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"experience"},{"content":" Programming Matlab (2 years) Python (5 years) C++ (2 years) bash, Linux, Microsoft Office, Adobe Illustrator, benchling Molecular Biology PCR-based cloning approaches Gibson Assembly, Overlap extension PCR, QuickChange, Restriction-enzyme based cloning DNA template design for protein expression and RNA in-vitro transcription Protein expression, purification and characterization RNA in-vitro transcription, purification and characterization Protein-protein \u0026amp; protein-RNA complex characterization via nanoDSF, MST, ITC, SEC-MALS, mass photometry Languages # German English Italian Russian native proficient entry level entry level ","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/experience/","section":"Marco Payr","summary":" Programming Matlab (2 years) Python (5 years) C++ (2 years) bash, Linux, Microsoft Office, Adobe Illustrator, benchling Molecular Biology PCR-based cloning approaches Gibson Assembly, Overlap extension PCR, QuickChange, Restriction-enzyme based cloning DNA template design for protein expression and RNA in-vitro transcription Protein expression, purification and characterization RNA in-vitro transcription, purification and characterization Protein-protein \u0026amp; protein-RNA complex characterization via nanoDSF, MST, ITC, SEC-MALS, mass photometry Languages # German English Italian Russian native proficient entry level entry level ","title":"Experience"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/","section":"Marco Payr","summary":"","title":"Marco Payr"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/tags/publications/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"publications"},{"content":" 2023 # Hollmann, Nele Merret, et al. \u0026ldquo;Upstream of N-Ras C-terminal cold shock domains mediate poly (A) specificity in a novel RNA recognition mode and bind poly (A) binding protein.\u0026rdquo; Nucleic Acids Research 51.4 (2023): 1895-1913.\n2022 # Nast-Kolb, T., et al. \u0026ldquo;VASP localization to lipid bilayers induces polymerization driven actin bundle formation.\u0026rdquo; Molecular Biology of the Cell 33.10 (2022): ar91.\n","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/publications/","section":"Marco Payr","summary":"2023 # Hollmann, Nele Merret, et al.","title":"Publications"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags"}]
